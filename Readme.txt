This folder contains all the files needed to run the Battery simulation model. Here are the following recommendations to run the files:

1. The model has been built using Matlab 2016b software. Please use 2016b or higher versions of matlab

2. I have defined a Graphical user interface in order to feed in the user requirements for the battery. In order to open the GUI, make sure you have added the current folder
   to your Matlab path. Type 'BattSim' in the Matlab command line to run the GUI

3. Once you feed in the requirements, hit the button 'Run NEDC Power Cycle' and the simulink model runs and plots are generated depicting the terminal voltage of the battery and the SOC of the Battery pack 

4. You can reset your entries by hitting the 'Reset' Button
